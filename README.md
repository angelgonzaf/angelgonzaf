- 👋 Hi, I’m Ángel and I am a Flutter developer. I studied Multimedia Engineering at University of Valencia and I am working in a global consulting company that offers custom made software. I am specialized in mobile app development.

- 🌱 I have also work at the backend with PHP and MySQL, maintaining the APIs. I have been coding in different types of projects, like a printer server in a Raspberry Pi with Linux and Nodejs and several frontend solutions with JavaScript and Angular.

- 👀 I started developing Android apps with Java, then I switched to multiplatform apps with Ionic Framework and Angular. After that, I discovered Flutter and now I am mastering my skills in this wonderful engine.
