- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @angelgonzaf and I am a Flutter developper. I studied Multimedia Engineering at University of Valencia and I am working in a marketing agency that offers custom made software. 

- ðŸŒ± Currently I also work at the backend with PHP and MySQL, maintaining the APIs for the apps that I am responsible of. I have been coding in different types of projects, like a printer server in a Raspberry Pi with Linux and Nodejs and several frontend solutions with JavaScript frameworks like Angular.

- ðŸ‘€ I started developing Android apps with Java, then I switched to multiplatform apps with Ionic Framework and Angular. After one year with Ionic, I discovered Flutter and now I am trying to master my skills with this wonderful engine.
